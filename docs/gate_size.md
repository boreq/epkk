## ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code

The ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code is included in ICAO Annex 14. It has two
'elements', the first is a numeric code based on the Reference Field Length for
which there are four categories and the second is letter code based on a
combination of aircraft wingspan and outer main gear wheel span.

| Code letter   | Wingspan              | Outer main gear wheel span    | Typical aeroplane                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| A             | < 15 m                | < 4.5 m                       | PIPER PA-31/CESSNA 404 Titan                                |
| B             | 15 m but < 24 m       | 4.5 m but < 6 m               | BOMBARDIER Regional Jet CRJ-200/DE HAVILLAND CANADA DHC-6   |
| C             | 24 m but < 36 m       | 6 m but < 9 m                 | BOEING 737-700/AIRBUS A-320/EMBRAER ERJ 190-100             |
| D             | 36 m but < 52 m       | 9 m but < 14 m                | B767 Series/AIRBUS A-310                                    |
| E             | 52 m but < 65 m       | 9 m but < 14 m                | B777 Series/B787 Series/A330 Family                         |
| F             | 65 m but < 80 m       | 14 m but < 16 m               | BOEING 747-8/AIRBUS A-380-800                               |
